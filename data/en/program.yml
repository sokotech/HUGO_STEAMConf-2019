LocalSpeaker02B : "**Helena González** and **Oriol Marimon**, Big Van Ciencia, IES Moises Broggi, IES Consell de Cent and IES Castellbisbal (Barcelona); **Casimiro Vizzini**, Expert at UNESCO's Division of Science Policy and Talent Development"

Text02B : At myPERFORM we talk about science with responsibility; we tackle social challenges, ethical dilemmas and gender inequalities; we identify pseudoscience and conflicts of interest but above all, we have a great time, we explore humour and we build scientific stories and perform them
 on stage.

Text02C : The myPERFORM project uses the performing arts to create an inclusive environment in which young people work together with researchers, their professors and science communicators, to explore science and technology issues and values. The final product of these participatory methodologies is a theatre piece (a scientific monologue, a sketch, a story ...) that can be represented on stage and that talks about real scientific or technological research. myPERFORM has made learning a participatory, "humanised" activity, put into the local context of students, and has contributed to the development of a reflective and informed population through science.

Text02D : The presentation of the myPERFORM project will be a spectacle. Literally. A show in which the monologues and theatrical sketches made by students from various schools in Barcelona will be interspersed, where we can answer questions such as = what can we do to stop climate change? How do we look for life on other planets? What new technologies are there for fighting cancer?

Text02E : MyPERFORM follows from the successes of its predecessor, the European Commission funded MyPERFORM project, to implement performance-based science education processes in countries worldwide.

Text02F : PERFORM has been a project financed by the European Union, implemented in Spain, the United Kingdom and France. The design and implementation of pedagogical activities has been led by Big Van Science (www.bigvanciencia.com).

Subtitle15 : "**Sebastian Martin**, Tinkering Studio. Exploratorium of San Francisco, USA."

LocalSpeaker15 : "**Òscar M. Ciuró**, cultural education manager. Thinking Doing Digital, Education and MakerConvent, Barcelona."

Text15 : We’ll delve into what it means to create STEAM-based learning experiences that fully embrace aesthetics as a way to engage young people physically, intellectually and emotionally. When learners are tinkering, wonder and delight are ever-present — and that is fun —.  So why is it undervalued in education?  It’s a pedagogy based on active engagement with materials and ideas aimed at cultivating curiosity.  We'll highlight dimensions of learning found in tinkering; a process where teachers and learners are changing their relationships to ideas, science phenomena and each other, redefining what counts as learning.

LocalSpeakerTitle15A : Sebastian Martin

Title23 : Bringing assessment culture to the 21st century – the power of innovative assessment

Subtitle23 : "**Juuso Henrik Nieminen**, Mathematics Education Research Group, University of Helsinki, Finland."

LocalSpeaker23 : "**Victoria Eugenia Ibáñez**, secondary education science and mathematics teacher, Barcelona."

Text23 : In 0.51 seconds, a Google search brings you over 139 million results for “21st century skills”. No doubt, educational levels from elementary schools to universities are buzzing about lifelong learning, metacognitive skills and critical thinking. However, even though curricula around the world are starting to value these skills, assessment culture lags behind. This is also true in Finland, where the new national curriculum in 2016 introduced new ideas such as programming skills and multidisciplinary learning but left the teacher-led assessment culture largely untouched. In his talk, Nieminen will introduce the newest research results concerning digital and innovative assessment from the University of Helsinki. It is argued that the core of our assessment methods has actually been pretty much the same for hundreds of years and ‘radical’ attempts to change it have not always end well. How could digital self- and peer-assessment support accessibility, student empowerment and ownership of learning?

LocalSpeakerTitle23A : Juuso Henrik Nieminen

LocalSpeakerText23A : Is an educational researcher and an assessment innovator from the University of Helsinki. He has taught mathematics and programming at many educational levels in Finland and currently trains future teachers in Helsinki. His research field is assessment of 21st century skills, concerning how innovative digital assessment could support the development of critical thinking and lifelong learning. Nieminen also works as a special educator, striving to build a more inclusive world through both his teaching and research. Currently, he is writing books on assessment culture in Finland and on innovative mathematics education, as well as working as a pedagogical specialist at Code School Finland. In addition, he is leading a math revolution with Math Hunger, aiming to make learning mathematics both fun and accessible for everyone. In 2018, Nieminen curated the theme “What should we learn next?” at Dare to Learn, the most innovative learning festival in Finland.

LocalSpeaker26 : "**Sergi del Moral**, teaching and management team at the Institut-Escola Les Vinyes de Castellbisbal, Barcelona."

Text26 : What if school was organised around the interests and natural curiosities of our students and teachers? What if the learning experience required you to get out of the building, observe the world, document findings and create/deliver beautifully crafted work that makes a real impact in the world beyond the school walls? The future of learning will look and feel less like school, as we currently know it, and more like students doing original, creative and meaningful work. Given the right conditions, young people will lead revolutions, invent new technologies, create new culture, new forms of expression, new genres of music and even new forms of government. With their boundless energy, they throw themselves into their work and they see old things in new ways. In this presentation, we’ll look at examples of student work, share some current experiments and show how we use human-centred design tools, methods and mindsets to make school more engaging, more interesting and more human. We will talk about the future of learning, school culture and creative leadership.

LocalSpeakerTitle26B : Sergi del Moral

LocalSpeakerText26B : Is interested in the processes of transformation that contribute to a more amiable and natural relationship between knowledge and learning. This has led him to explore how to compensate for the weight of materials and static knowledge in favour of approaches that are more focused on action, production, creation, problem solving, teamwork and learning for real life situations. He’s also interested in everything that makes assessment more of a diagnostic rather than coercive process, as well as in the classroom and community dynamics that promote autonomy, initiative and responsibility among the boys and girls. He is currently part of the teaching and management team of the Institut-Escola Les Vinyes de Castellbisbal and also forms part of the team that promotes BetaCamp, a highly rewarding peer learning experience.
