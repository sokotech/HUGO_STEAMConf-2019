WorkshopTitle03 : Co-creating the assessment cultures of the future

WorkshopSubtitle03 : Juuso Henrik Nieminen, Mathematics Education Research Group, University of Helsinki, Finland

WorkshopText03 : What will our assessment methods look like in the future? Our knowledge about pedagogy is shaping curricula around the world but what lags behind is the educational assessment culture. In order to truly promote 21st century skills through education, our understanding of assessment has to change as well. In this research-based workshop, some Finnish examples of the assessment for learning movement are introduced. It is argued that in order to promote innovative assessment cultures, collaboration between various agents is needed. Thus, the participants will need to collaborate in order to co-create dystopian and utopian assessment cultures for the future. After discovering these extreme futures of assessment, the workshop will focus on the practical side of changing the assessment culture. How could we collaboratively create an assessment culture that would be based on supporting learning inclusively, rather than simply dividing learners into groups based on measuring their skills and knowledge?

WorkshopSpeakerTitle03A : Juuso Henrik Nieminen

WorkshopSpeakerText03A : Is an educational researcher and an assessment innovator from the University of Helsinki. He has taught mathematics and programming at many educational levels in Finland and currently trains future teachers in Helsinki. His research field is assessment of21st century skills, concerning how innovative digital assessment could support the development of critical thinking and lifelong learning. Nieminen also works as a special educator, striving to build a more inclusive world through both his teaching and research. Currently, he is writing books on assessment culture in Finland and on innovative mathematics education, as well as working as a pedagogical specialist at Code School Finland. In addition, he is leading a math revolution with Math Hunger, aiming to make learning mathematics both fun and accessible for everyone. In 2018, Nieminen curated the theme "What should we learn next?" at Dare to Learn, the most innovative learning festival in Finland.

WorkshopSubtitle04 : Fina Guitart, Laura Farró, Ester Forné, Joan Jareño, Sílvia Margelí,  Roser Martínez, Jordi Regalès, Pilar Reverté, Elena Gayán i Julio Pérez. CESIRE, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona

WorkshopText04 : On the occasion of the International Year of the Periodic Table (2019 IYPT), we present a didactic proposal in the form of an escape room that will introduce competences and knowledge on the periodic table and the elements in the classroom. The tasks and situations to be solved integrate knowledge of various fields with the backbone of the key ideas that the periodic table represents for the sciences and specifically for chemistry. The game format aims to involve students and create an enjoyable experience, while sharing knowledge and cooperating with their peers using their abilities and competences in the fields of languages, arts, social sciences, mathematics and technology.

WorkshopText07 : Even if it may seem incredible, quantum physics has an important impact on our daily life; without it, we would not have developed useful technologies, like lasers, LEDs and transistors. But hold on! Many more are about to come, like 100% secure online communications and quantum computers, as we are at the beginning of a quantum technological revolution, the so called Second Quantum Revolution. The ICFO outreach team has worked in the last years on many and diverse materials that you can directly bring to the classroom to introduce some of the basic concepts that are at the base of actual research and technological development in quantum physics. With a wide range of classroom activities, from card games up to virtual tours in the quantum world, we will show you how quantum physics can get to your class, so that your students can be part of the upcoming quantum revolution!

WorkshopSubtitle10 : Jordi Regales, Jordi Achon and Jaume Riera, Technology Department, CESIRE, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona

WorkshopText10 : This workshop presents a didactic STEAM proposal, which aims to provide students in secondary education with the cognitive construction of knowledge about electricity and magnetism. This knowledge will allow us to understand the functioning of the gadgets of our civilisation, such as the generation, transportation and utilisation of electrical energy in the home, public spaces, industry, commerce and transport. The proposal is characterised by active learning through the construction of devices for experimentation, integrating elements of maker culture and 3D printing, and is reflected in several projects that can be carried out in the technology classroom and science laboratory (with exploration activities using magnets, the construction of electromagnets and motors, discovery of the principle of electromagnetism and construction of an electric generator and a wind turbine).

WorkshopSubtitle11 : Eugènia Mestre, coordinator of Visual Plastic Education; Carme Mercè, coordinator and specialist of Sensory Plastic Education; David Hispano, responsible for educational innovation projects, Fundació Collserola, Barcelona

WorkshopText11 : Technological resources are steadily moving forward and securing an indisputable place in the way in which children interact with their natural environment. Normalising their use in school allows us to create learning situations closer to the concerns and interests of the students and helps us to connect with their way of interacting with the world and to approach situations of significant learning. We understand technological tools to be resources throughout the processes of artistic learning. We propose small experiences using these resources, based on activities that we have carried out at our schools, in the context of Artistic-Plastic education. The proposals cover different moments of artistic practice; the analysis, observation and perception of the models; the tasks of designing and producing the work and the use of technologically-generated resources as teaching materials to accompany and facilitate the learning of of every student.

WorkshopSpeakerTitle11A : Eugènia Mestre

WorkshopSpeakerText11A : Is a graduate in psychology and in teaching and plastic arts. She works as a specialist in Visual and Plastic Education, is the subject coordinator and Head of Department (Primary) at Fundació Collserola.
