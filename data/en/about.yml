Info01 : STEAMConf reaches its fifth edition, gathering an exceptional group of international and local creators in Barcelona, who address the world from an (A) perspective and with an integral vision that promotes STE(A)M; from the music of Sam Aaron to PERFORM’s theatre or the art of Tate, among other experiences that, on the basis of PBL (project-based learning), life experiences and assessment, accomplish an act of intense creation.

Info01A :

Info02 : “Creating is the best strategy for survival in a changing world”

Info02A :  Jorge Wagensberg

Info03 : “The next phase of the Digital Revolution will bring a true fusion of technology with the creative industries. This innovation will come from people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. In other words, it will come from the spiritual heirs of Ada Lovelace, creators who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder that opens them to the beauty of both.”

ItemSteeringTitle06: Julio Pérez
ItemSteeringText06 : Director del CESIRE, Departament d'Ensenyament, Generalitat de Catalunya. Em situo a la frontera entre l'educació i la divulgació i comunicació de la ciència. Crec que un bon professor no està lluny de ser un comunicador amb fonaments de didàctica i del seu camp de coneixement, i altes capacitats d'observació i empatia. He exercit la docència a secundària i la universitat, he fet formació de professorat (inicial i permanent) i també em trobo molt còmode treballant amb mestres de primària (infantil em fa molt de respecte, i ho deixo pels professionals). Defenso una educació pública de qualitat, que formi ciutadans crítics, amb criteri propi i capaços de desenvolupar-se de forma autònoma en una societat tecnificada que canvia molt ràpidament.
